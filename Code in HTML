<h2 id="section-1">The Meaning and Reasoning behind the Hijab</h2>
<p>Many believe that the only reason to wear the hijab is to cover themselves modestly from unrelated males but it's more
than that.<br> Linguistically, hijab means <strong>“barrier”</strong>, and muslim women <em>chose</em> to wear the
hijab because it is instructed by Allah to do so in the Quran.<br> However, hijab is more than just a piece of cloth, it's a
<strong>mentality</strong> , a symbol of modesty,a statement that we <strong>value our religious beliefs and character
above our appearances</strong>. <br>It’s more like a reminder to most to watch what they do and or say because they are
physically representing islam and people automatically recognize us as muslims. <br>Personally for me, it helps me be
closer to Allah SWT. The struggles and hardships you face because of the hijab really helps push you closer to Allah.<br>
The courage, strength, and confidence I received because of the hijab is unimaginable. <br>Of course everyone has their
own different opinions and experiences on the hijab but these are a few of mine. </p>
<h2 id="section-2"> Some Reasons to start wearing the Hijab</h2>
<ol>
<li>Its <strong>fardh</strong> ( It states in the quran that muslim women should cover modestly and men should lower
their gaze. )</li>
<li>You don’t <em>blindly</em> follow fashion trends and society to their standards of beauty. You are a
<strong>leader</strong> not a follower.</li>
<li>Allah is the <strong>most knowledgeable</strong>, how can he doubt him? If a doctor gives us a prescription do we question it? So how can we question the all knower. </li>
<li>Hijab is an act of iman. It helps increase our iman and <strong>protects</strong> us from bad intentions. (Surah An
Nur)</li>
<li>It makes many more confident and empowered. It’s your body. You're in control.</li>
<li>Your body is an <strong>amanah</strong>. Treat your body the way the creator instructed. If you stayed at someone's
house and they gave you a list of instructions to follow, will you break them?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-3">A Beginner Guide to Hijabs </h2>
<p> When you start the hijab, you may or may not know alot about it. Here are the basics about hijabs and different types
of fabrics. </p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Jersey Hijab</strong> </li>
</ul>

alt="jersey-hijab" width="20%">
<p>This fabric is comfortable, stretchable, and lightweight fabric that remains the same shape without pins. It’s also good
for any season. It works well with hotter climates as it is cool and absorbs sweat and is still durable to keep warm in the
winter. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chiffon Hijab </strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Chiffon is a transparent/sheer fabric that is luminous, has an excellent drape, breathable, and cool on hot days. Chiffon
gives off a silk look but it easily slips off without pins. Chiffon fabrics usually come in solid colors and go for many beginner
hijabis.

<p>Many girls that live in cool/cold weather must often wear this fabric. It keeps you warm and stays in shape well without
pins. It is very comfortable to wear and looks classy.</p>
<ul>

<li> <strong>Satin Hijab</strong></li>
</ul>
<img id="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRpmTEgku0xICro0- QNlw2OUrBs58FnTYaCyA&usqp=CAU"alt="Satin-hijab" width="15%">
<p>These hijabs are beautiful, shiny, silky fabrics that are non-see through, light weight and give great coverage and confidence. These Hijabs do need pins if you are wearing them for a long period of time.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Polyester Silk Hijab</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>
These Hijabs are super trendy, classy, and elegant looking. Though I would not use this as a go to hijab fabric because
you will need a lot of pins but when you get a hang of it it will be worthwhile. If it still slips off then maybe put a thin hijab under and pair it with this fabric.</p>
<ul>
<li> Magnetic Pins </li>
</ul>
<p>
Magnetic pins are the fastest and simplest way to keep your scarf in place. These pins save so much time compared to
the traditional pin. These are efficient and don’t hurt. They get the job done and make it easier to adjust the scarf. These pins
are a better alternative for beginner hijabis that don't know how to deal with a pin.</p>
